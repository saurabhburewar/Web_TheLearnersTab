## Features

### History
Check your last activity and continue where you left off, right from your new tab.
- The history component offers a filtered view of your browser history.
- We offer two default filters - Stackoverflow and YouTube, the two most useful resources for starting as well as experienced developers.
- We also provide a third filter which can be customized for any keyword of your liking.

### Github (public) support
Check your public github resources. Just enter your username in settings. 
- Access your public repos and gists right from the new tab. You can check which repos have open issues and start working with a click.
- Check all the issues that were recently visited, so you can continue working on an issue or revisit a previous issue.
- Shows all the pull requests that were recently visited by the user, so you can quickly check if there are any updates in you PR.

### Quick Links
We got you some default links covering your social networks like facebook, instagram, linkedin and even slack. We also have a panel for you to add your own links.
- You can also group your links!
- Links can be easily added to a group by right-clicking and selecting the option while you are on a website.
- We also support importing and exporting your list, so you dont have to set it all up again, when switching laptops/browsers.

### Todo list
A simple list to track all your to-dos, so you can come back to work the next day, without worrying about forgetting something. No need to track stuff on other apps, or your phone, just do it where it will always be visible, right on the browser.
Also, serves as a reminder to do something when you are distracted.

### Screen Timer
- Tracks the amount of time you spent on a website on your browser, so you can limit the time spent watching youtube videos.
- With a click of a button, the data can viewed as a chart (which is default) or a list.

## Theme for chrome
